            Sometimes you hear about people getting "food poisoning." This means
            that they got sick from microbes in food. Keep yourself safe by
            following the "Tips for Healthy Living" below. Tips for Healthy
            Living. Eat a variety of foods, including plenty of vegetables,
            fruits, and grain products, such as pasta, cereals, tortillas, and
            breads.

          <p>
            Shef, an Airbnb-like platform for home cooked meals, is ramping up
            to meet that demand while providing opportunities for immigrants to
            earn money by sharing the home cooking of their cultures. On
            Thursday, the San Francisco-based startup announced a $8.8 million
            funding round to expand its network of chefs delivering home-cooked
            meals. Y Combinator and Craft Ventures participated in the round, as
            well as angel investors like TaskRabbit CEO Stacy Brown-Philpot and
            Instacart cofounders Max Mullen and Brandon Leonardo.
